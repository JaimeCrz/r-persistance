# r-persistance is a to-do app with Four Main Branches

This is a to-do app that aims to implement four different methods of information persistence. Each method will be implemented in a separate branch to explore the pros and cons of each method. The four main branches are:

    localstorage-functional-components: This branch will implement the use of LocalStorage with functional components. This method will rely on the browser's LocalStorage API to store the to-do list data.

    localstorage-redux-store: This branch will implement the use of LocalStorage with Redux store. This method will use the LocalStorage API to persist the Redux store's state.

    redux-persist: This branch will implement the use of the Redux Persist package. This package provides a simple way to persist and rehydrate a Redux store. It uses AsyncStorage on React Native and LocalStorage on the web.

    react-cookie: This branch will implement the use of the react-cookie package. This package provides a simple way to persist data using cookies. It can be used to store user preferences or session data.

Each branch will have its own README file that explains how the method works and its benefits and drawbacks. This will help me compare and contrast the different methods for possible future use cases.

I hope this project will be helpful to anyone who wants to learn more about data persistence in web applications using React.
